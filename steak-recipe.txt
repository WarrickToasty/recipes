How to make a steak that everyone will RAVE about

Ingredients: 

Steak 
Vingegar 
Salt 
Pepper 
Garlic Salt 
Onion Salt 
Red Peppers 
Montreal Steak Seasoning 

Preparation: Take the steaks and marinate them in Vinegar for approximately 2-3 hours (not too longer or it will overpower the meat, and not too short or it won't flavor the meat. You want the vinegar to add a "zing" to the taste of the meat, nothing more) 

Add salt, pepper, garlic salt, onion salt, and red peppers to one side. Then, pound the seasoning into the meat with a meat pounder (don't know what exactly it's called). Flip the steak, and do the same thing. 

Toss the steak into the pan (or for best taste put it on the grill) and cook it, poke the meat with a fork continually while cooking and add the Montreal Steak Seasoning to it as it cooks (applying it to both sides). 

Cook until you have it cooked the way you like (I always eat mine well done).
